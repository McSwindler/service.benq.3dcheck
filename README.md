Kodi Addon to automatically switch BenQ Projectors to the correct 3D mode

In order to work, you must connect to your BenQ projector's RS232 port. You can do so directly via a serial port (or USB to Serial converter) on your computer, or through a RS232 to TCP/IP converter.

If using a TCP/IP converter, select the 'TCP-IP - Network Serial Connection' option in the plugin settings and enter the IP address and port number associated with your converter.
Otherwise, select the appropriate COM port in the plugin settings.
